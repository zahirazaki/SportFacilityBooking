# Name of The Proposed Website
### IIUM Sport Facility Booking 
## Introduction
In our rapidly advancing world, where time is a precious commodity, the necessity for efficiency and convenience has never been more pronounced. This is particularly evident in the context of sports facility management at the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). Recognizing the imperative to enhance the user experience for both students and the broader community, we propose the implementation of a cutting-edge Sport Facility Booking System for the Female Sport Center (FSC) and Male Sport Center (MSC). This innovative system seeks to revolutionize the antiquated methods of facility booking, offering a streamlined and user-friendly interface that simplifies the entire process which is from reservation to scheduling.
Traditionally, the process of booking sports facilities has been marred by inefficiencies and errors. Manual methods, such as paper forms or phone reservations, not only consumed valuable time but also introduced the risk of miscommunication and confusion. Our proposed Sport Facility Booking System is a solution designed to overcome these challenges. By harnessing modern technology, users can now effortlessly access and manage bookings for a range of facilities, including sports fields, courts, swimming pools, and gyms, bringing unprecedented ease and accuracy to the process. This system promises to be a catalyst for positive change, fostering a culture of accessibility and efficiency in sports facility management at IIUM.

## Objectives Of The Website
The development of this system is based on the following objectives:

- Enable users to create accounts and profiles, facilitating personalized experiences and allowing them to track their booking history.
- Users may verify availability before making a reservation on time or adjust the date, place, day, and so on before submitting the application.
- Provide a user-friendly platform that is accessible to a wide range of users, including athletes, teams, and organizers.
- A low-cost, high-performance solution, so that this system may reduce the cost of traditional methods of making reservations.
- To assist administrators in keeping track of booking records, locating them in the database, and managing bookings as well as redundancy schedules.
  
## Features and Functionalities
For our Sport Facility Booking System, we have included some features that can be used by the student and administration such as create account,make reservation,cancel reservation,⁠update reservation and  ⁠track the booking history. We are also developing for the use of both administrators and users where the users will be able to book a venue while the administrator will be able to see and record our booking history.

1. Main Page-
The first feature is the main page.This page displays the website’s logo and slogan to emphasize its purpose. Upon interaction the signup/login interface  appears, presenting the users with two buttons: sign up and log in. Once they have completed the sign-up form, they can click on the sign-up button, which will redirect them to the login page.


2. Login/Create Account-
In the event that users click on the login button without having a registered account, they still have the option to sign up. At the bottom of the login page, there is a prompt that says, "Don't have an account? Sign up." Clicking on this prompt will take users to the sign-up page. Upon logging in, the homepage gracefully appears on the screen. It encompasses essential elements such as a navigation bar, and a convenient log-out option.  To enhance user navigation, categories are presented in text format and also accompanied by corresponding icons that show two categories: male sports center and female sports center.

3. Make Reservation-
Next, the users will be directed to the venue booking interface page. When users select the venue at the website, they can click on the sport categories, and the interface displays the venue details in a visually appealing manner. For instance, if a male user searches for a stadium, the interface showcases an image of the stadium, accompanied by its location and facility. Availability slots depend on the date, time and day of the venue.If there is an availability slot, the user may book their slot based on their desired times.

4. Update Reservation-
The update reservation feature allows users to modify existing bookings seamlessly. Whether it's adjusting the date, time, location, or duration of the reservation, users can make real-time changes, ensuring their plans align with evolving schedules.

5. Cancel Reservation-
The system ensures that the cancellation process is straightforward, with users receiving confirmation prompts to confirm their intent.

6. Track Booking History-
This website also allows the user and staffs to track their booking history.It will include their details of their reservations such as time, dates,days and venue.This feature also helps administrators to record the reservation activity for each venue.
