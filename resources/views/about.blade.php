            The sports section in IIUM was established in 1983. Since then, sports have become vibrant activities in IIUM. In 1990, the sports activities in IIUM have drastically increased in term of quantity and quality.  In 1991, the role of sports section became more demanding when IIUM was indirectly involved with the World University Sports Federation (FISU), Asian University Sports Federation (AUSF) and AseanUniversity Sports Council (AUSC).
